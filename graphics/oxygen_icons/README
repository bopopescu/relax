======

The oxygen icons:

    https://api.kde.org/frameworks/oxygen-icons5/html/index.html

were obtained from r1421027 of the SVN repository:

    svn://anonsvn.kde.org/home/kde/trunk/kdesupport/oxygen-icons

prior to the conversion to git.


relax versions
==============

The following changes (performed in the GIMP) were used to create the *-relax-blue.png versions of the oxygen icons:

Green               97
Yellow              ?

Y hue               .       .
Y lightness         .       -44
Y saturation        .       -36
R hue               .       .
R lightness         .       -44

    Cyan - Red = -100
    Magenta - Green = 10
