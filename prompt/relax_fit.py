        run:  The name of the run.


        Errors of individual residues at a single time point
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        The standard deviation for a single residue at a single time point is calculated by the
        formula

        -----
                     ____________________________
            sd =   \/ sum({Ii - Iav}^2) / (n - 1) ,

        -----

        where n is the total number of collected spectra for the time point and i is the
        corresponding index, Ii is the peak intensity for spectrum i, Iav is the mean over all
        spectra, ie the sum of all peak intensities divided by n.


        Averaging of the errors
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        As the value of n in the above equation is always very low, normally only a couple of
        spectra are collected per time point, the standard deviation of all residues is averaged for
        a single time point.  Although this results in all residues having the same error, the
        accuracy of the error estimate is significantly improved.


        Errors across multiple time points
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        If all spectra are collected in duplicate (triplicate or higher number of spectra are
        supported), the each time point will have its own error estimate.  However, if there are
        time points in the series which only consist of a single spectrum, then the standard
        deviations of replicated time points will be averaged.  Hence, for the entire experiment
        there will be a single error value for all residues and for all time points.

        A better approach rather than averaging across all time points would be to use a form of
        interpolation as the errors across time points generally decreases for longer time periods.
        This is currently not implemented.

        Keyword Arguments
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        run:  The name of the run.

        file:  The name of the file containing the sequence data.

        dir:  The directory where the file is located.

        relax_time:  The time, in seconds, of the relaxation period.

        format:  The type of file containing peak intensities.

        heteronuc:  The name of the heteronucleus as specified in the peak intensity file.

        proton:  The name of the proton as specified in the peak intensity file.

        int_col:  The column containing the peak intensity data (for a non-standard formatted file).


        Description
        ~~~~~~~~~~~

        The peak intensity can either be from peak heights or peak volumes.


        The format argument can currently be set to:
            'sparky'
            'xeasy'

        If the format argument is set to 'sparky', the file should be a Sparky peak list saved after
        typing the command 'lt'.  The default is to assume that columns 0, 1, 2, and 3 (1st, 2nd,
        3rd, and 4th) contain the Sparky assignment, w1, w2, and peak intensity data respectively.
        The frequency data w1 and w2 are ignored while the peak intensity data can either be the
        peak height or volume displayed by changing the window options.  If the peak intensity data
        is not within column 3, set the argument int_col to the appropriate value (column numbering
        starts from 0 rather than 1).

        If the format argument is set to 'xeasy', the file should be the saved XEasy text window
        output of the list peak entries command, 'tw' followed by 'le'.  As the columns are fixed,
        the peak intensity column is hardwired to number 10 (the 11th column) which contains either
        the peak height or peak volume data.  Because the columns are fixed, the int_col argument
        will be ignored.


        The heteronuc and proton arguments should be set respectively to the name of the
        heteronucleus and proton in the file.  Only those lines which match these labels will be
        used.
