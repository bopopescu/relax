        Description
        ~~~~~~~~~~~

        This function creates a PDB file containing an artificial geometric structure to represent
        the diffusion tensor.  A structure must have previously been read into relax.  The diffusion
        tensor is represented by an ellipsoidal, spheroidal, or spherical geometric object with its
        origin located at the centre of mass (of the selected residues).  This diffusion tensor PDB
        file can subsequently read into any molecular viewer.

        There are four different types of residue within the PDB.  The centre of mass of the
        selected residues is represented as a single carbon atom of the residue 'COM'.  The
        ellipsoidal geometric shape consists of numerous H atoms of the residue 'TNS'.  The axes
        of the tensor, when defined, are presented as the residue 'AXS' and consist of carbon atoms:
        one at the centre of mass and one at the end of each eigenvector.  Finally, if Monte Carlo
        simulations were run and the diffusion tensor parameters were allowed to vary then there
        will be multiple 'SIM' residues, one for each simulation.  These are essentially the same as
        the 'AXS' residue, representing the axes of the simulated tensors, and they will appear as a
        distribution.

        As the Brownian rotational diffusion tensor is a measure of the rate of rotation about
        different axes - the larger the geometric object, the faster the diffusion of a molecule.
        For example the diffusion tensor of a water molecule is much larger than that of a
        macromolecule.

        The effective global correlation time experienced by an XH bond vector, not to be confused
        with the Lipari and Szabo parameter tau_e, will be approximately proportional to the
        component of the diffusion tensor parallel to it.  The approximation is not exact due to the
        multiexponential form of the correlation function of Brownian rotational diffusion.  If an
        XH bond vector is parallel to the longest axis of the tensor, it will be unaffected by
        rotations about that axis, which are the fastest rotations of the molecule, and therefore
        its effective global correlation time will be maximal.

        To set the size of the diffusion tensor within the PDB frame the unit vectors used to
        generate the geometric object are first multiplied by the diffusion tensor (which has the
        units of inverse seconds) then by the scaling factor (which has the units of second
        Angstroms and has the default value of 1.8e-6 s.Angstrom).  Therefore the rotational
        diffusion rate per Angstrom is equal the inverse of the scale value (which defaults to
        5.56e5 s^-1.Angstrom^-1).  Using the default scaling value for spherical diffusion, the
        correspondence between global correlation time, Diso diffusion rate, and the radius of the
        sphere for a number of discrete cases will be:

        _________________________________________________

        |___________|_______________|___________________|


        The scaling value has been fixed to facilitate comparisons within or between publications,
        but can be changed to vary the size of the tensor geometric object if necessary.  Reporting
        the rotational diffusion rate per Angstrom within figure legends would be useful.

        To create the tensor PDB representation, a number of algorithms are utilised.  Firstly the
        centre of mass is calculated for the selected residues and is represented in the PDB by a C
        atom.  Then the axes of the diffusion are calculated, as unit vectors scaled to the
        appropriate length (multiplied by the eigenvalue Dx, Dy, Dz, Dpar, Dper, or Diso as well as
        the scale value), and a C atom placed at the position of this vector plus the centre of
        mass.  Finally a uniform distribution of vectors on a sphere is generated using spherical
        coordinates.  By incrementing the polar angle using an arccos distribution, a radial array
        of vectors representing latitude are created while incrementing the azimuthal angle evenly
        creates the longitudinal vectors.  These unit vectors, which are distributed within the PDB
        frame and are of 1 Angstrom in length, are first rotated into the diffusion frame using a
        rotation matrix (the spherical diffusion tensor is not rotated).  Then they are multiplied
        by the diffusion tensor matrix to extend the vector out to the correct length, and finally
        multiplied by the scale value so that the vectors reasonably superimpose onto the
        macromolecular structure.  The last set of algorithms place all this information into a PDB
        file.  The distribution of vectors are represented by H atoms and are all connected using
        PDB CONECT records.  Each H atom is connected to its two neighbours on the both the
        longitude and latitude.  This creates a geometric PDB object with longitudinal and
        latitudinal lines.

        Description
        ~~~~~~~~~~~

        The reading of PDB files into relax is quite a flexible procedure allowing for both models,
        defined as an ensemble of the same molecule but with different atomic positions, and
        different molecules within the same model.  One of more molecules can exist in one or more
        models.  The flexibility allows PDB models to be converted into different molecules and
        different PDB files loaded as the same molecule but as different models.  This flexibility
        is controlled by the four keyword arguments 'read_mol', 'set_mol_name', 'read_model', and
        'set_model_num'.

        A few different PDB parsers can be used to read the structural data.  The choice of which to
        use depends on whether your PDB file is supported by that reader.  These are selected by
        setting the 'parser' argument to one of:

            'scientific' - the Scientific Python PDB parser.
            'internal' - a lower quality and less reliable, although faster, PDB parser built into
                relax.

        In a PDB file, the models are specified by the MODEL PDB record.  All the supported PDB
        readers in relax recognise this.  The molecule level is quite different between the
        Scientific Python and internal readers.  For how Scientific Python defines molecules, please
        see its documentation.  The internal reader is far simpler as it defines molecules using the
        TER PDB record.  In both cases, the molecules will be numbered consecutively from 1.

        The 'set_mol_name' argument is used to name the molecules within the PDB (within one
        model).  If not set, then the molecules will be named after the file name, with the molecule
        number appended if more than one exists.

        Note that relax will complain if it cannot work out what to do.


        Examples

        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        attached:  The name of the second atom which attached to the spin of interest.  Regular
        expression is allowed, for example 'H*'.

        spin_id:  The spin identification string.

        model:  The model to extract bond vectors from (which if set to None will cause the vectors
        of all models to be extracted).

        verbosity:  The amount of information to print to screen.  Zero corresponds to minimal
        output while higher values increase the amount of output.  The default value is 1.

        ave:  A flag which if True will cause the bond vectors from all models to be averaged.  If
        vectors from only one model is extracted, this argument will have no effect.

        unit:  A flag which if True will cause the unit vector to calculated rather than the full
        length bond vector.


        Description
        ~~~~~~~~~~~

        For a number of types of analysis, bond vectors or unit bond vectors are required for the
        calculations.  This user function allows these vectors to be extracted from the loaded
        structures.  The bond vector will be that from the atom associated with the spin system
        loaded in relax to the bonded atom specified by the 'attached' argument.  For example if
        'attached' is set to 'H' and the protein backbone amide spins 'N' are loaded, the all 'N-H'
        vectors will be extracted.  But if set to 'CA', all atoms named 'CA' in the structures will
        be searched for and all 'N-Ca' bond vectors will be extracted.

        The extraction of vectors can occur in a number of ways.  For example if an NMR structure
        with N models is loaded or if multiple molecules, from any source, of the same compound are
        loaded as different models, there are three options for extracting the bond vector.  Firstly
        the bond vector of a single model can be extracted by setting the 'model' argument.
        Secondly the bond vectors from all models can be extracted if 'model' is None and 'ave' is
        set to False.  Thirdly, if 'model' is None and 'ave' is set to True, then a single vector
        which is the average for all models will be calculated.


        Example
        ~~~~~~~

        To extract the XH vectors of the backbone amide nitrogens where in the PDB file the backbone
        nitrogen is called 'N' and the attached atom is called 'H', assuming multiple types of
        spin have already been loaded, type one of:

        relax> structure.vectors(spin_id='@N')
        relax> structure.vectors('H', spin_id='@N')
        relax> structure.vectors(attached='H', spin_id='@N')

        If the attached atom is called 'HN', type:

        relax> structure.vectors(attached='HN', spin_id='@N')

        For the 'CA' spin bonded to the 'HA' proton, type:

        relax> structure.vectors(attached='HA', spin_id='@CA')


        If you are working with RNA, you can use the residue name identifier to calculate the
        vectors for each residue separately.  For example to calculate the vectors for all possible
        spins in the bases, type:

        relax> structure.vectors('H2', spin_id=':A')
        relax> structure.vectors('H8', spin_id=':A')
        relax> structure.vectors('H1', spin_id=':G')
        relax> structure.vectors('H8', spin_id=':G')
        relax> structure.vectors('H5', spin_id=':C')
        relax> structure.vectors('H6', spin_id=':C')
        relax> structure.vectors('H3', spin_id=':U')
        relax> structure.vectors('H5', spin_id=':U')
        relax> structure.vectors('H6', spin_id=':U')

        Alternatively, assuming the desired spins have been loaded, regular expression can be used:

        relax> structure.vectors('H*')
