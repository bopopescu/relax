        runs:  An array containing the names of all runs to hybridise.


        Description
        ~~~~~~~~~~~

        This user function can be used to construct hybrid models.  An example of the use of a
        hybrid model could be if the protein consists of two independent domains.  These two domains
        could be analysed separately, each having their own optimised diffusion tensors.  The
        N-terminal domain run could be called 'N_sphere' while the C-terminal domain could be called
        'C_ellipsoid'.  These two runs could then be hybridised into a run called 'mixed model' by
        typing

        relax> run.hybridise('mixed model', ['N_sphere', 'C_ellipsoid'])
        relax> run.hybridise(hybrid='mixed model', runs=['N_sphere', 'C_ellipsoid'])

        This hybrid run can then be compared via model selection to a run where the entire protein
        is assumed to have a single diffusion tensor.

        The only requirements for runs to be hybridised is that, at minimum, a sequence has been
        loaded, that the sequence for all hybridised runs is the same, and that no residue is
        allowed to be selected in two or more runs.  The last condition is to ensure that overlap
        does not occur to allow statistically significant comparisons.
