"""Script for the determination of relative stereochemistry.

The analysis is preformed by using multiple ensembles of structures, randomly sampled from a given
set of structures.  The discrimination is performed by comparing the sets of ensembles using NOE
violations and RDC Q-factors.

This script is split into multiple stages:

    1.  The random sampling of the snapshots to generate the N ensembles (NUM_ENS, usually 10,000 to
    100,000) of M members (NUM_MODELS, usually ~10).  The original snapshot files are expected to be
    named the SNAPSHOT_DIR + CONFIG + a number from SNAPSHOT_MIN to SNAPSHOT_MAX + ".pdb", e.g.
    "snapshots/R647.pdb".  The ensembles will be placed into the "ensembles" directory.

    2.  The NOE violation analysis.

    3.  The superimposition of ensembles.  For each ensemble, Molmol is used for superimposition
    using the fit to first algorithm.  The superimposed ensembles will be placed into the
    "ensembles_superimposed" directory.  This stage is not necessary for the NOE analysis.

    4.  The RDC Q-factor analysis.

    5.  Generation of Grace graphs.
