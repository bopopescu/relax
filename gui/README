**************************************************


Requirements:
=============

relaxGUI is a graphical interface for the software package 'relax', which can be downloaded from www.nmr-relax.com. Make sure 'relax' works properly and a symbolic link for relax exists (symbolic link shoud be 'relax'). 

To create a symbolic link of relax, type: 
  $ sudo ln -s [directory of relax]/relax /usr/local/bin/relax


relaxGUI is written in python and uses wx.pathon for its GUI:

  http://www.wxpython.org/


Installation:
=============

There is no installation required. 

Start relaxGUI by typing

   $ relax relaxGUI

It is recommended to start relaxGUI from a terminal, as progress of relax can be observed in real time.


Program:
========

relaxGUI is designed to create and run scripts for 'relax'. Furthermore, it is able to manage your 15N-NMR relaxation projects from generating NOE, T1 and T2 parameters until Model-free analysis. In addition, relaxGUI creates publication quality graphes and figures of the results.

To set up relaxGUI, a PDB structure file as well as steady-state NOE, T1 and T2 peaklists are required.


Workflow:
=========

relaxGUI is designed to work in a pragmatic manner. Several tabs will guide the way until Model-free analysis. The best way is to always work your way from left to right and from top down to Results.

Example:
  - Create New Project
  - NOE 1st frequency
  - T1 1st frequency
  - T2 1st frequency
  - NOE 2nd frequency
  - T1 2nd frequency
  - T2 2nd frequency
  - NOE 3rd frequency
  - T1 3rd frequency
  - T2 3rd frequency
  - Model-free analysis
       Local tm > Sphere > Prolate > Oblate > Ellipsoid > Final


After completing the Final run, results may be evaluated in the Results section.
