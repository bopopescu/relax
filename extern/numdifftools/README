Origin
======

This is an import of the Numdifftools 0.6.0 package into the relax source tree.
    
This package is extremely useful for testing the implementation of gradients, Hessians, and Jacobians for all relax target functions.  The numerical values from numdifftools can be compared to the directly calculated values.  And for analysis types where the partial derivatives with respect to each model parameter are too complicated to calculated, or the derivatives are very complicated and hence slow, numdifftools can be used to provide a numerical estimate for direct use in the optimisation.
    
The Numdifftools package is from https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Numdifftools and https://code.google.com/p/numdifftools/.  The current version 0.6.0 has been placed into extern/numdifftools.  This is only the numdifftools package within the official distribution files and the Python package setup.py file and associated files and directories have not been included.  The package uses the New BSD licence (the revised licence with no advertising clause) which is compatible with the GPL v3 licence.
