integrate_2d example
====================

Introduction
------------

This example contains a Python script (integrate_2d.py) which integrates peaks 
in a 2D NMR spectrum 

Instructions
------------

1. Run integrate_2d.py to intergrate the spectrum in nmrpipe_2d/test.ft2 given
limits in `limits.in`, storing the results in `volumes.out`

Notes
-----
The data in the nmrpipe_2d directory is identical to the nmrpipe_2d directory 
which appears can be created from the agilent_test_data archive.  If this 
example is run from within a git repository a symbolic link can be made to 
this directory to save disk space.
