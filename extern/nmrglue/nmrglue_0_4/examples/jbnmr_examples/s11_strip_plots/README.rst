3D strip plot example
=====================

Introduction
------------

This example is taken from Listing S11 from the 2013 JBNMR nmrglue paper.  In 
this example a three 3D solid state NMR spectra are visualized as strip plots.


Instructions
------------

Process each of the three 3D spectra by decending into the appopiate directory
and executing the `fid.com` followed by the `xy.com` NMRPipe scripts.


Execute `python make_strip_plots.py` to create the strip plots.  The resulting
file `strip_plots.png` is presented as Figure 6 in the paper.
