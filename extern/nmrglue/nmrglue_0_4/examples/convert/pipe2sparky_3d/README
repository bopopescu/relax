pipe2sparky_3d example
======================

Introduction
------------

This example contains a NMRPipe script (pipe2pipe_3d.com) which processes time
domain NMRPipe data, a Python script (pipe2sparky_3d.py) which converts a 3D 
NMRPipe file in a Sparky formatted file, a script (pipe2sparky_3d.com) which 
performs the same conversion using pipe2ucsf, a Python script (compare.py) to 
compare the results of the conversions, and an example 3D NMRPipe data set.

Instructions
------------

1. Run pipe2pipe_3d.com to process the 3D time domain NMRPipe data.

2. Run pipe2sparky_3d.py to perform the conversion using nmrglue.  This 
creates the NMRPipe file `sparky_3d.ucsf`.

3. If Sparky is installed, run the pipe2sparky_3d.com script to perform the
same conversion with pipe2ucsf, this step is only necessary if one wishes to
compare the results from the two conversions.  This script creates the file
sparky_3d.ucsf in the nmrpipe_3d directory.

4. Run compare.py to compare the Sparky files created by the two above 
scripts. A few differences in the date and time meta-data are expected and 
will be reported.

Notes
-----
The data in the nmrpipe_3d directory is identical to the nmrpipe_3d directory 
which appears can be created from the agilent_test_data archive.  If this 
example is run from within a git repository a symbolic link can be made to 
this directory to save disk space.  Step 2 can also be skipped if the
conversion script is run from within the test data directory.
