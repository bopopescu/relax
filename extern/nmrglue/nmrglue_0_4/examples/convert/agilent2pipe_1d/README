agilent2pipe_1d example
=======================

Introduction
------------

This example contains a Python script (agilent2pipe_1d.py) which converts a 
1D Agilent/Varian data set into a NMRPipe formatted file, a NMRPipe script 
(agilent2pipe_1d.com) which performs the same conversion, a Python script 
(compare.py) to compare the results of the conversions, and an example 1D 
Agilent/Varian data set.

Instructions
------------

1. Run agilent2pipe_1d.py to perform the conversion using nmrglue.  This 
creates the NMRPipe file `pipe_1d.fid`.

2. If NMRPipe is installed, run the agilent2pipe_1d.com script to perform the
same conversion with NMRPipe, this step is only necessary if one wishes to
compare the results from the two conversions.  This script creates the file
test.fid in the agilent_1d directory.

3. Run compare.py to compare the NMRPipe files created by the two above 
scripts. A few differences in the date and time meta-data are expected and will
be reported.

Notes
-----
The data in the agilent_1d directory is identical to the agilent_1d directory 
which appears in the agilent_test_data archive.  If this example is run from
within a git repository a symbolic link can be made to this directory to save
disk space.  Step 2 can also be skipped if the conversion script is run from
within the test data directory.
