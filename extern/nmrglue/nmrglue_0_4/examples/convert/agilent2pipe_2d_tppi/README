agilent2pipe_2d_tppi example
============================

Introduction
------------

This example contains a Python script (agilent2pipe_2d_tppi.py) which converts 
a 2D Agilent/Varian data set into a NMRPipe formatted file, a NMRPipe script 
(agilent2pipe_2d_tppi.com) which performs the same conversion, a Python script 
(compare.py) to compare the results of the conversions, and an example 2D 
Agilent/Varian data set.

Instructions
------------

1. Run agilent2pipe_2d_tppi.py to perform the conversion using nmrglue.  This 
creates the NMRPipe file `2d_pipe_tppi.fid`.

2. If NMRPipe is installed, run the agilent2pipe_2d_tppi.com script to perform 
the same conversion with NMRPipe, this step is only necessary if one wishes to
compare the results from the two conversions.  This script creates the file
test.fid in the agilent_2d_tppi directory.

3. Run compare.py to compare the NMRPipe files created by the two above 
scripts. A few differences in the date and time meta-data are expected and will
be reported.

Notes
-----
The data in the agilent_2d_tppi directory is identical to the agilent_2d_tppi 
directory which appears in the agilent_test_data archive.  If this example is 
run from within a git repository a symbolic link can be made to this directory 
to save disk space.  Step 2 can also be skipped if the conversion script is run
from within the test data directory.
