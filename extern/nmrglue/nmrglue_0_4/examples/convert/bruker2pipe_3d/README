bruker2pipe_3d example
======================

Introduction
------------

This example contains a Python script (bruker2pipe_3d.py) which converts a 3D 
Bruker data set into NMRPipe formatted files in the data directory, a NMRPipe 
script (bruker2pipe_3d.com) which performs the same conversion, a Python script 
(compare.py) to compare the results of the conversions, and an example 3D 
Bruker data set.

Instructions
------------

1. Run bruker2pipe_3d.py to perform the conversion using nmrglue.  This 
creates the NMRPipe files in the data directory.

2. If NMRPipe is installed, run the bruker2pipe_3d.com script to perform the
same conversion with NMRPipe, this step is only necessary if one wishes to
compare the results from the two conversions.  This script creates the file
fid in the bruker_3d directory.

3. Run compare.py to compare the NMRPipe files created by the two above 
scripts. A few differences in the date and time meta-data are expected and will
be reported.

Notes
-----
The data in the bruker_3d directory is identical to the bruker_3d directory 
which appears in the bruker_test_data archive.  If this example is run from
within a git repository a symbolic link can be made to this directory to save
disk space.  Step 2 can also be skipped if the conversion script is run from
within the test data directory.
