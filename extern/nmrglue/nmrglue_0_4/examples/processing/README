process_pipe_* example
======================

Introduction
------------

This example contains a Python script (process_pipe_*.py) for processing a 
NMRPipe file, a NMRPipe script (pipe2pipe_*.py) to perform the same processing 
using NMRPipe, a Python script (compare_*.py) to compare the results, and 
sample time domain NMRPipe data.

Instructions
------------

1. Run process_pipe_Nd.py to process the time domain NMRPipe data using nmrglue,
replace N with the correct dimension.

2. If NMRPipe is install run pipe2pipe_Nd.com to process the data using NMRPipe.

3. Compare the results of the two processing methods by running compare_Nd.py

Notes
-----
The data in the nmrpipe_* directory is identical to the nmrpipe_( directory 
which can be created using the agilent_test_data archive.  If this example is 
run from within a git repository a symbolic link can be made to this directory 
to save disk space.  Step 2 can also be skipped if the conversion script is run
from within the test data directory.
