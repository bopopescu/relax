plot_2d_* examples
==================

Introduction
------------

This example contains four Python scripts (plot_spectrum.py, 
plot_spectrum_pts.py, plot_boxes.py and plot_assignments.py) which create 
figures of 2D NMR spectrum stored in a NMRPipe file. Sample 2D NMRPipe data 
is also included.

Instructions
------------

1. Run plot_spectrum.py to create the file `spectrum.png` 

2. Run plot_spectrum_pts.py to create the file `spectrum_pts.png` 

3. Run plot_assignments.py to create the file `assignments.png` with boxes
around peaks listed in limits.in

4. Run plot_boxes.py to create a file for each peak in limits.in.


Notes
-----
The data in the nmrpipe_2d directory is identical to the nmrpipe_2d directory 
which can be created using the agilent_test_data archive.  If this example is 
run from within a git repository a symbolic link can be made to this directory 
to save disk space.  Step 2 can also be skipped if the conversion script is run
from within the test data directory.
