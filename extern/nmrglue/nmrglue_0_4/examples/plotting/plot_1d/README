plot_1d_time and plot_1d_freq examples
======================================

Introduction
------------

This example contains Python scripts (plot_1d_pipe_freq.py and
plot_1d_pipe_time.py) which create figures of 1D NMRPipe data in the time and
frequency domain.  Sample 1D NMRPipe data is also included.

Instructions
------------

1. Run plot_1d_pipe_time.py to create the file `fid.png` 

2. Run plot_1d_pipe_freq.py to create the file `spectrum.png` 

Notes
-----
The data in the nmrpipe_1d directory is identical to the nmrpipe_1d directory 
which can be created using the agilent_test_data archive.  If this example is 
run from within a git repository a symbolic link can be made to this directory 
to save disk space.  Step 2 can also be skipped if the conversion script is run
from within the test data directory.
