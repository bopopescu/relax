interactive_1d example
===========2==========

Introduction
------------

This example contains a Python script 2d_interactive.py which creates an
interactive session for examining a 2D NMR spectrum.  

Instructions
------------

1. Run 2d_interactive.py.

Notes
-----
The data in the nmrpipe_2d directory is identical to the nmrpipe_2d directory 
which appears can be created from the agilent_test_data archive.  If this 
example is run from within a git repository a symbolic link can be made to 
this directory to save disk space.
