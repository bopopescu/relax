Description
===========

Optimisation of SOD1-WT CPMG. From paper at U{http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0907387106}.

Optimisation of Kaare Teilum, Melanie H. Smith, Eike Schulz, Lea C. Christensen, Gleb Solomentseva, Mikael Oliveberg, and Mikael Akkea 2009 
'SOD1-WT' CPMG data to the CR72 dispersion model.

This uses the data from paper at U{http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0907387106}.  This is CPMG data with a fixed relaxation time period recorded at fields of 500 and 600MHz.
Data is for experiment at 25 degree Celcius.
