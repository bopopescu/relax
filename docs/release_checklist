1.  Make a copy of the current head to the tags directory using a command such as:

$ svn cp svn+ssh://bugman@svn.gna.org/svn/relax/1.2 svn+ssh://bugman@svn.gna.org/svn/relax/tags/1.2.4

In the commit message, have a header line which says 'relax version 1.2.4.', followed by a description of the release.



2.  Checkout the tagged version with:

$ svn co svn+ssh://bugman@svn.gna.org/svn/relax/tags/1.2.4 relax



3.  Change the version number in file 'version.py'.



4.  Generate the binary and source distribution files (and their GPG signatures) by typing:

$ make binary_dist
$ make source_dist



5.  Commit the changes so the 'tags' directory is updated.



6.  Move the distribution files and their signatures, as well as the PDF manual, to the mirror directory for the relax download site.  This directory should contain all the files and directories accessible from 'http://download.gna.org/relax/'.  Rsync the entire directory contents to download.gna.org/upload/relax/ using the command

$ rsync --delete -avr --rsh="ssh" * bugman@download.gna.org:/upload/relax/



7.  Modify the http://nmr-relax.com download page to point to the newest version of relax.



8.  Create the HTML version of the manual with the command:

$ make manual_html

Replace the old manual with the new in the CVS repository.
