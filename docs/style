Indentation
~~~~~~~~~~~

Indentation should be set to four spaces rather than a tab character.  This is the recommendation
given in the python style guide found at 'http://www.python.org/doc/essays/styleguide.html'.  For
vi, add the following lines to '~/.vimrc':

set tabstop=4
set shiftwidth=4
set expandtab

Certain versions of vim, in the 6.2 series, contain a bug where the tabstop value cannot be changed
using the '~/.vimrc' file (although typing ':set tabstop=4' in vim will fix it).  One solution is to
edit the file 'python.vim' which is located in the path '/usr/share/vim/ftplugin/' or equivalent.
It contains the two lines:

" Python always uses a 'tabstop' of 8.
setlocal ts=8

If these lines are deleted, the bug will be removed.  Another way to fix the problem is to install
newer versions of the runtime files (which will pretty much do the same thing).


Doc strings
~~~~~~~~~~~

These should be set to no more than 100 characters long including all leading whitespace.
