Indentation
~~~~~~~~~~~

Indentation should be set to four spaces rather than a tab character.
For vi, add the following lines to '~/.vimrc':

set tabstop=4
set shiftwidth=4
set expandtab

Recent versions of vim contain a bug where the tabstop value cannot be changed using the '~/.vimrc'
file (although typing ':set tabstop=4' in vim will fix it).  A permanent solution is to edit the
file 'python.vim' which is located in the path '/usr/share/vim/ftplugin/' or equivalent.  It
contains the comment '" Python always uses a 'tabstop' of 8.' and the setting 'setlocal ts=8'.  If
these are deleted, the bug will be permanently removed!


Doc strings
~~~~~~~~~~~

These should be set to no more than 100 characters long.
