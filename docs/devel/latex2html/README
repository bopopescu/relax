relax specific branch
=====================

The origin LaTeX2HTML git repository is:

    https://github.com/latex2html/latex2html

For relax, this repository has been forked and a few relax specific patches applied.  These changes can be found in the relax_manual/rX branches.  Please checkout the latest branch to compile the relax manual.  The forked repository is located at:

    https://sourceforge.net/p/nmr-relax/code-latex2html/ci/master/tree/

And mirrored at:

    https://github.com/nmr-relax/latex2html
    https://gitlab.com/nmr-relax/latex2html
    https://bitbucket.org/nmr-relax/latex2html


Building latex2html
===================

To compile and install latex2html into /usr/local, type:

$ git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/nmr-relax/code-latex2html relax-latex2html
$ cd relax-latex2html
$ git checkout relax_manual/rX
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/
$ make
$ su
# make install

Note that perl-doc needs to be installed, and that 'X' in the branch relax_manual/rX should be replaced by the highest revision number in the repository.
