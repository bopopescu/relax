# Installation instructions for the program relax #
###################################################


Dependencies
============

The following packages need to be installed before using relax:

    Python:  Version 2.2 or higher.

    Numeric:  Version 21 or higher.

    ScientificPython:  Version 2.2 or higher.

Older versions of these packages may work but no guarantees can be made.



Installation
============

Linux:
------


To install the program relax, first put the compressed archive in /usr/local/ and untar using the
command:

    $ tar jxvf relax.tar.bz2

Then either make a link in usr/local/bin to the file relax/relax using the command,

    $ ln -s /usr/local/relax/relax /usr/local/bin/relax

or make an alias to the file by adding the following lines for the bash or csh/tcsh shells.

Bash (global /etc/bashrc, local ~/.bashrc):
    alias relax="/usr/local/relax/relax"

Csh / Tcsh (global /etc/csh.cshrc, local ~/.csh or ~/.tcsh):
    alias relax "/usr/local/relax/relax"



Post install
============

For faster loading of the program, run the program once as root so that all the '.pyc' files are
created.  Simply typing 'relax' in a shell and then exiting is sufficient.



Optional programs
=================

The following is a list of programs which can be used by relax, although they are not essential for
normal use.


OpenDX:
-------

Version 4.1.3 or compatible.  OpenDX is used for viewing the output of the space mapping function,
and is executed by passing the command 'dx' to the command line with various options.


VMD:
----

Version 1.8 or higher.  VMD is used for viewing the collection of molecules extracted from a PDB
file.  It is executed through the Scientific function 'view()' which requires the environmental
variable 'PDBVIEWER' to be set to 'vmd'.

For Bash, add the following line to either the global '/etc/profile' or local '~/.bash_profile'
files:
    export PDBVIEWER='vmd'

For Csh / Tcsh, add the following line to either the global '/etc/csh.cshrc' or local '~/.csh' or
'~/.tcsh' files:
    setenv PDBVIEWER 'vmd'
