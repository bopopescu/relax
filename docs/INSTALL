Dependencies
============

The following packages need to be installed before using relax:

    Python:  Version 2.2 or higher.

    Numeric:  Version 21 or higher.

    ScientificPython:  The scientific python package is actually required by the Molecular
      Modelling Toolkit.  Version 2.2 or higher.

    MMTK:  The Molecular Modelling Toolkit.  Version 2.2 or higher.

Older versions of these packages may work but no guarantees can be made.


Installation
============

Linux:
------


To install the program relax, first put the compressed archive in /usr/local/ and untar using the
command:

    $ tar jxvf relax.tar.bz2

Then either make a link in usr/local/bin to the file relax/relax using the command,

    $ ln -s /usr/local/relax/relax /usr/local/bin/relax

or make an alias to the file by adding the following lines for the bash or csh/tcsh shells.

Bash (global /etc/bashrc, local ~/.bashrc):
alias relax="/usr/local/relax/relax"

Csh / Tcsh (global /etc/csh.cshrc, local ~/.csh or ~/.tcsh):
alias relax "/usr/local/relax/relax"



Post install
============

For faster loading of the program, run the program once as root so that all the '.pyc' files are
created.  Simply typing 'relax' in a shell and then exiting is sufficient.
