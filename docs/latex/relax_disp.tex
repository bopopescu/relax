\section{Introduction to relaxation dispersion}

Relaxation dispersion is the modulation of chemical exchange relaxation through the NMR pulse sequence.  For the $\Ronerho$-type experiment in which the nucleus of interest is spin-locked, either the spin-lock field strength or the offset between the spin-lock pulse and the chemical shift of the spins is modulated.  For the CPMG-type experiment, this time between the pulses is moduled.  Both experiment types are handled by relax.
