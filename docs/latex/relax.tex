\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

Firstly, I am grateful and would like to thank Paul Gooley for giving me the opportunity to create this program as part of my PhD.  The duration of development has been considerable and I thank Paul for allowing me the time to learn Python and to implement many data analysis concepts into relax.

I would also like to thank Andrew James Perry for innumerable, thoughtful discussions on both the science and programming aspects behind relax.  Many of the important design features of relax originated as ideas of his and much of the usability and core layout came from these discussions.  Examples include the prompt based interface with the help system and tab completion, the automatic generation of the documentation on the user functions by parsing their docstrings, details of the interaction with and control of other programs, and the powerful Python scripting.  Without Andrew, this program would not be what it is today.

Finally I would like to thank Haydyn D.T. Mertens and James D. Swarbrick for many discussions and feedback.
