\section{Coding conventions}


% Indentation.
\subsection{Indentation}

Indentation should be set to four spaces rather than a tab character.  This is the recommendation given in the python style guide found at \texttt{`http://www.python.org/doc/essays/styleguide.html'}.  For vi, add the following lines to \texttt{`\~/.vimrc'}:

\begin{exampleenv}
set tabstop=4 \\
set shiftwidth=4 \\
set expandtab
\end{exampleenv}

Certain versions of vim, those within the 6.2 series, contain a bug where the tabstop value cannot be changed using the \texttt{`\~/.vimrc'} file (although typing \texttt{`:set tabstop=4'} in vim will fix it).  One solution is to edit the file \texttt{`python.vim'} which is located in the path \texttt{`/usr/share/vim/ftplugin/'} or equivalent. It contains the two lines:

\begin{exampleenv}
" Python always uses a `tabstop' of 8. \\
setlocal ts=8
\end{exampleenv}

If these lines are deleted, the bug will be removed.  Another way to fix the problem is to install newer versions of the run-time files (which will pretty much do the same thing).


% Doc strings.
\subsection{Doc strings}

These should be set to no more than 100 characters long including all leading white space.  The standard Python convention of a one line description separated from a detailed description by an empty line should be adhered to.
